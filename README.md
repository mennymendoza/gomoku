# Gomoku CSCI 130 Project

## Setting Up

Get started by running the init_db.php script on your local server.
This can be done by simply typing in the URL in the browser.
Example: localhost/mysite/gomoku/php/init_db.php

If you have issues, make sure that your MySQL root username and password match the username and password
in init_db.php. The same applies if you want to drop the gomoku database with drop_db.php.

Once you've run init_db.php script, you should be good! You should be able to use the application with no issues.
